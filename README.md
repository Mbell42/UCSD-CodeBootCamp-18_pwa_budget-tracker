# 18_pwa_budget-tracker
For this homework project, I will add functionality to a provided initial/existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget both with and without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, then the transactions should populate the total when brought back online.
